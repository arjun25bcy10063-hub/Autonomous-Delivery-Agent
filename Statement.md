Problem Statement:-
The delivery agents are not able to find the most cost efficient and time saving way to reach a particular destination.

Scope of the Project:-
he project's scope is to demonstrate and compare various pathfinding algorithms (BFS, UCS, A*) in environments with both static and moving obstacles, highlighting how an agent can dynamically replan its route to reach a goal.

Target Users:-
   1. Students
   2. Office workers
   3. Residents ordering food, groceries, or documents

High-Level Features:-
   1.Builds a grid world: Creates a virtual map with different areas and obstacles.
   2.Adds moving obstacles: Includes enemies or moving blocks that change position.
   3.Finds paths: Uses different smart methods (BFS, UCS, A*) to navigate the agent.
   4.Reacts to changes: The agent can quickly find a new path if its way gets blocked by a moving obstacle.
   5.Compares methods: It tests and shows which pathfinding method works best in different situations.
