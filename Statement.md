1. Problem Statement
Traditional delivery is expensive, slow, and relies heavily on human labor. Traffic congestion and high costs make "last-mile" delivery inefficient. Additionally, there is a growing need for contactless options to ensure safety and hygiene.

2. Scope of the Project
We are building a self-driving robot designed to carry small packages on sidewalks and within gated communities.

Includes: Building the robot hardware, navigation software, and a mobile app for users.

Excludes: Driving on main roads/highways or carrying heavy industrial loads.

3. Target Users
End Users: Students, office workers, and residents ordering food, groceries, or documents.

Businesses: Local restaurants and shops looking for a cheaper, automated way to deliver goods.

4. High-Level Features
Autonomous Navigation: The robot drives itself, detects obstacles, and safely navigates around pedestrians.

Secure Storage: The cargo bay stays locked and only opens when the recipient scans a code on their phone.

Real-Time Tracking: Users can track the robot's location live on a map.

Auto-Return: The robot automatically returns to its station to recharge when the delivery is done.
