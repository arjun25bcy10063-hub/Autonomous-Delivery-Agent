AUTONOMOUS DELIVERY AGENT

Over View Of The Project:- This project explores pathfinding algorithms (BFS, UCS, A*) in a grid. It models a world with static and moving obstacles, allowing an agent to plan and replan its path to a goal. It also includes tools to test and compare how efficiently these algorithms work on different maps.

Features:- 
   1. Grid Environment: A navigable 2D map with different terrains and obstacles.
   2. Dynamic Obstacles: Moving blockages that change position.
   3. Pathfinding Algorithms: Implements BFS, UCS, and A* to find paths.
   4. Agent Replanning: The agent dynamically adjusts its path if obstacles appear.
   5. Performance Metrics: Measures algorithm speed, path cost, and efficiency.
   6. Map Generation: Creates various test maps.
   7. Visualization: Plots experiment results for comparison.
