Autonomous Delivery Agent

The agent's objective is to evaluate BFS, UCS, and A*'s performance (path cost, execution time, nodes expanded) quantitatively across a range of map sizes and complexity levels.  Demonstrate how an agent can change course in real time in response to obstacles that move.
 
Key Features:-

This project demonstrates the principles of pathfinding—the process by which robots decide where to go and the most cost-effective path.
Environmental interaction is the act of moving within a designated area.
Important Components of Smart Navigation: The agent finds the shortest route from start to finish using algorithms like BFS or A*.
Obstacle Avoidance: By identifying walls and blocks, the agent automatically steers clear of obstacles.
Dynamic Grid: It is easy to alter the size of the city and the locations of obstacles.
Visual Output: Watch the agent move step-by-step through the console or terminal.
